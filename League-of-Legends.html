        <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game
          developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III,
          Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009,
          League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is
          available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

          In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and
          defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with
          unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting
          experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode,
          Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large
          structure located within.

          League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character
          designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews
          trending positively; the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players, criticized since early in the
          game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, League regularly peaked at
          eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books,
          short stories, and the animated series Arcane. Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games,
          including a mobile version, a digital collectible card game and a turn-based role-playing game, among others.
          A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the property is in development.</p>
